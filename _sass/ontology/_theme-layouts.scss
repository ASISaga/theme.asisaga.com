/**
 * THEME LAYOUTS & COMPONENTS - Ontology-Based
 * ============================================================================
 * This file provides ontology-based styling for all theme layouts and components.
 * It replaces legacy CSS with pure semantic ontological mixins.
 * 
 * ALL theme HTML (layouts & includes) should use semantic class names,
 * and this file maps those classes to ontological roles.
 * 
 * ZERO raw CSS properties - everything through ontology mixins.
 * 
 * NOTE: This file has been refactored for maintainability. All layout
 * and component styles are now in the theme-layouts/ subdirectory.
