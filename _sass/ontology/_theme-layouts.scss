/**
 * THEME LAYOUTS & COMPONENTS - Ontology-Based
 * ============================================================================
 * This file provides ontology-based styling for all theme layouts and components.
 * 
 * NOTE: All theme layout and component styles have been consolidated into
 * the /_sass/components directory for better organization and maintainability.
 * This file now serves as a compatibility layer that imports from components.
 * 
 * The theme-layouts subdirectory has been merged into components, combining
 * best features from both locations.
