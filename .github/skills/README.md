## Available Skills

### 1. theme-genome-agent

**Role**: Ontological Gatekeeper and Evolution Manager

Manages the evolutionary growth of the Genesis Semantic Design System by reviewing ontological propositions from subdomains, ensuring semantic purity, and maintaining the three-tier architecture.

**Use when**: Reviewing PRs with `ontological-proposition` label, evaluating new variant requests, or managing design system evolution.

**NEW Automation**:
```bash
# Validate ontology changes
./.github/skills/theme-genome-agent/scripts/validate-ontology.sh
```

### 2. subdomain-evolution-agent

**Role**: Ontological Proposition Creator

Identifies semantic gaps in the design system and creates well-formed propositions for new ontological variants based on real-world usage patterns.

**Use when**: Subdomain development reveals missing semantic patterns, or repeatedly combining mixins in the same way.

### 3. figma-design-bridge-agent (NEW v2.2)

**Role**: Design-to-Code Translation Specialist

Translates Figma designs into Genesis Semantic Design System code. Extracts design tokens via Figma MCP, maps components to ontological variants, and maintains bidirectional design-code traceability.

**Use when**: Implementing Figma designs, extracting design tokens, validating implementation against Figma source, identifying semantic gaps from design patterns.

**MCP Integration**: `https://mcp.figma.com/mcp`

**Resources**:
- `figma-mcp.md` - Complete Figma MCP integration guide

- Convert hex colors to OKLCH format
- Map Figma components to ontological variants
- Generate semantic HTML and ontological SCSS
- Identify semantic gaps revealed by design
- Document Figma source and mapping decisions

### 4. scss-refactor-agent

**Role**: Ontology Migration Expert

Converts legacy CSS/SCSS into ontological mixin-based code, ensuring "zero-CSS compliance" where subdomain stylesheets use only Genesis Semantic mixins.

**Use when**: Migrating subdomain from legacy CSS, auditing SCSS for raw CSS violations, or refactoring theme components.

**NEW Automation**:
```bash
# Validate SCSS file for zero-CSS compliance

### 5. html-template-agent

**Role**: Semantic Structure and Accessibility Expert

Ensures all HTML follows semantic best practices, uses meaningful content-first class names, and meets WCAG AA accessibility standards.

**Use when**: Creating Jekyll layouts/includes, auditing HTML for accessibility, or implementing semantic class naming.

**NEW Automation**:
```bash
# Validate HTML template
./.github/skills/html-template-agent/scripts/validate-html.sh path/to/template.html
```

### 6. responsive-design-agent

**Role**: Mobile-First Responsive Specialist

Implements mobile-first responsive patterns with proper WCAG 2.5.5 touch targets (44px minimum), fluid typography, and responsive grids.

**Use when**: Implementing responsive layouts, optimizing mobile UX, or ensuring accessibility compliance across viewport sizes.

### 7. futuristic-effects-agent

## Using Skills

### For AI Agents

Skills are designed to be loaded by AI agents when needed:

1. **Discovery**: Agent reads skill metadata (name, description) to identify relevant skills
2. **Activation**: When task matches, agent loads full SKILL.md content
3. **Execution**: Agent follows instructions and best practices in the skill
4. **Resources**: Agent loads additional files (scripts, references) as needed

### For Human Developers

Skills serve as comprehensive guides for working with the Genesis Semantic Design System:

- Read SKILL.md files to understand agent workflows
- Use as reference for ontological principles and patterns
- Follow examples and best practices
- Understand the decision-making process behind design system evolution

## Ontological Categories Reference

The Genesis Semantic Design System has 6 ontological categories with 31+ variants:

1. **Environment** (8 variants) - Spatial logic and layout patterns
2. **Entity** (8 variants) - Visual presence and glassmorphism
3. **Cognition** (6 variants) - Typography based on semantic meaning
4. **Synapse** (6 variants) - User interactions and navigation
5. **State** (6 variants) - Temporal conditions and system status
6. **Atmosphere** (7 variants) - Sensory texture and emotional tone

See `_sass/ontology/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md` for complete variant reference.

## Design System Architecture

The Genesis Semantic Design System uses a three-tier architecture:

**Tier 1: Content (HTML)**
- Defines WHAT the data is
- Semantic HTML5 with meaningful class names
- Lives in subdomain repositories

**Tier 2: Interface (Ontological Mixins)**
- Defines the ROLE of content
- Agnostic semantic mixins (no CSS properties)
- Lives in `_sass/ontology/_interface.scss`

**Tier 3: Engine (Visual Implementation)**
- Defines the LOOK (OKLCH, Bento, Glassmorphism)
- The ONLY place for raw CSS properties
- Lives in `_sass/ontology/_engines.scss`

## Evolutionary Process

The design system grows through an **Ontological Proposition** process:

1. **Subdomain identifies gap** (subdomain-evolution-agent)
2. **Creates well-formed PR** with semantic justification
3. **Theme reviews proposal** (theme-genome-agent)
4. **Implements if approved** in engine layer
5. **Documents in GENOME.md** with PR origin
6. **Subdomain adopts** new variant

This creates a **living genome** where the design system evolves based on real usage patterns.
