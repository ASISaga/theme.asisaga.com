# Agent System Specifications

This directory contains specifications and frameworks for the agent intelligence system.

## Files

- **`agent-intelligence-framework.md`** - Complete framework for establishing Copilot agent ecosystems
  - Five-pillar structure (agents, instructions, prompts, skills, copilot-instructions.md)
  - Tool leverage patterns (reference, don't duplicate)
  - Validation workflows
  - Context window optimization

## Purpose

Specifications define **how** the agent system works and **what** patterns to follow. Unlike instructions (which are path-activated for specific file types), specs are reference documents.

## Usage

Reference these specs when:
- Creating new agents, prompts, or skills
- Understanding system architecture
- Implementing validation workflows
- Adapting system to new repositories
