# Agent Metrics Directory

This directory stores historical agent quality metrics for tracking the Ouroboros self-improvement loop.

## Purpose

The agent intelligence system practices **dogfooding** - using the same standards it enforces. This directory tracks:

- **Spec coverage**: Percentage of agents with proper references
- **Context efficiency**: Information density per token
- **Duplication rate**: Repeated content across files
- **Quality trends**: Optimal vs needs improvement over time

## Files

Metrics are recorded with timestamps:
- `metrics-YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.txt` - Complete metrics snapshot
- Generated by GitHub Actions workflow and manual runs

## Usage

### View Latest Metrics
```bash
ls -t .github/metrics/metrics-*.txt | head -1 | xargs cat
```

### View Historical Trends
```bash
npm run metrics:agents:history
```

### Manual Recording
```bash
npm run metrics:agents
```

## Automated Tracking

The `agent-quality.yml` GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
- Records metrics on every PR affecting agent files
- Runs weekly audits (Sundays at 00:00 UTC)
- Uploads metrics as artifacts (90-day retention)

## Metrics Targets

From `.github/docs/dogfooding-guide.md`:

- **Spec Coverage**: ≥90% (currently: varies)
- **Optimal Agents**: ≥80% (currently: varies)
- **Context Efficiency**: ≥85 (currently: varies)
- **Duplication**: 0 instances
- **All agents**: ≥3 spec references
