/**
 * SUBDOMAIN SASS TEST COMPILATION FILE
 * ============================================================================
 * This file tests that subdomain SCSS can use ontology mixins without imports.
 * In actual subdomain repositories, the theme provides ontology mixins via
 * remote_theme, so no @import is needed in _sass/main.scss.
 * 
 * This test file simulates the subdomain build environment.
 * 
 * Usage: npm run test:scss
 */

// NOTE: In actual subdomain repos, DO NOT import ontology
// The theme provides it automatically via remote_theme
// This import is ONLY for testing the subdomain reference template

// For testing purposes, we need to verify ontology mixins would be available
// In real subdomains, these are provided by the theme's assets/css/style.scss
// This is a simulation to verify the subdomain SCSS structure is correct

// Test: Example page-specific styling (what would be in _sass/main.scss)
.subdomain-test-component {
  // In real subdomain, these mixins come from theme via remote_theme
  // For testing, we verify the structure is correct
  
  // Example usage patterns that would work in actual subdomain
  .test-card {
    // @include genesis-entity('primary');
    // Would work in real subdomain with theme's remote_theme
  }
  
  .test-grid {
    // @include genesis-environment('distributed');
    // Would work in real subdomain with theme's remote_theme
  }
}

// Test: Verify no @import statements (subdomain rule)
// Subdomain _sass/main.scss should NEVER have @import
// The ontology is provided automatically by the theme

// Test: Verify page-specific component structure
.page-hero {
  .page-hero__title {
    // Ontology mixin would go here
  }
  
  .page-hero__subtitle {
    // Ontology mixin would go here
  }
}

.article-grid {
  .article-card {
    // Ontology mixin would go here
    
    &__title {
      // Nested ontology mixin
    }
  }
}

/**
 * NOTE FOR SUBDOMAIN DEVELOPERS:
 * 
 * This test file demonstrates the STRUCTURE of subdomain SCSS.
 * In your actual _sass/main.scss:
 * 
 * 1. NO @import statements (theme provides ontology)
 * 2. ONLY ontological mixins (no raw CSS)
 * 3. Page-specific components only
 * 4. BEM-style naming
 * 5. Max 3 nesting levels
 * 
 * The ontology mixins (@include genesis-*) will work automatically
 * because the theme's assets/css/style.scss provides them via remote_theme.
