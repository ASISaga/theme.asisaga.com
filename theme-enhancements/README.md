# Theme Enhancements for Genesis Ontological Design System

This directory contains proposals for new ontological variants needed to support businessinfinity.asisaga.com subdomain styling requirements.

## Purpose

These files document styling patterns currently implemented with raw CSS that need to be elevated to the Genesis Ontological Design System in the theme repository (`ASISaga/theme.asisaga.com`).

## Process

1. **Analyze** - Review raw CSS usage in subdomain SCSS files
2. **Propose** - Create ontological variant proposals that capture semantic intent
3. **Submit** - Manual PR to theme repository with these enhancements
4. **Migrate** - Once theme is updated, migrate subdomain to use new variants

## Structure

Each proposal file should contain:
- **Semantic justification** - What meaning does this variant convey?
- **Use cases** - Where in the subdomain is this needed?
- **Implementation** - Suggested mixin code for theme
- **Migration path** - How to convert existing raw CSS

## Current Proposals

See individual files in this directory for specific enhancement proposals.
