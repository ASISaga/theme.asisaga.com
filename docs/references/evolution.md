This mechanism transforms your theme repository into a Living Genome. The key is that the Theme Agent acts not as a passive librarian, but as an Ontological Gatekeeper. It must evaluate whether a subdomain's request is a new "Species" (a new mixin) or a "Genetic Mutation" (a refinement of an existing one).
Here is the protocol for the Evolutionary PR System, designed for the Theme Agent to manage incoming intelligence from the subdomain nodes.
## 🧬 The Evolutionary Handshake Protocol
The system relies on a "Request-Classification-Review" cycle. When a Subdomain Agent identifies a gap, it doesn't just ask for a "style"; it submits a Proposition of Meaning.
### 1. The Subdomain PR Template (The "Intent" Document)
The Subdomain Agent must populate this header in every Pull Request:
## 🧩 Ontological Proposition
**Source Node:** [e.g., Subdomain-Quantum-Logs]
**Intent (The 'What'):** Defining a new cognitive frequency for 'Incomplete Data'.
**Context (The 'Why'):** Standard 'protocol' mixin implies certainty. We need a way to represent data that is currently being computed (non-deterministic).

## 🔭 Proposed Role
- **Type:** [Environment / Entity / Cognition / Synapse]
- **Suggested Label:** `cognition('speculation')`
- **Relationship:** This is a sister-state to `cognition('protocol')` but with lower visual frequency.

### 2. The Theme Agent’s Review Logic (The "Brain")
Upon receiving a PR, the Theme Agent does not simply merge. it performs Reclassification Analysis to prevent system bloat. It follows this decision tree:
 * Redundancy Check: "Does an existing role already cover this intent?"
   * If yes: Deny PR; instruct Subdomain Agent to re-map to the existing role.
 * Generalization Check: "Is this intent unique to one site, or is it a universal ASI state?"
   * If universal: Add to the global interface.scss.
   * If unique: Create a "Sub-Species" within the Theme Engine.
 * Ontological Refactoring: "Does this new request suggest that an older category should be split or merged?"
   * Example: If three subdomains ask for slightly different 'buttons', the Theme Agent should refactor genesis-synapse into more granular "Neural Vectors."
## 🛠️ Theme Agent Implementation: The "Self-Documenting" Log
To make the design system self-documenting, the Theme Agent maintains a GENOME.md (or updates the interface.scss comments) dynamically. Each mixin is tagged with the originating intent of the PR that created or modified it.
/**
 * @param $intent [speculation] 
 * ORIGIN: PR #42 (Subdomain-Quantum-Logs)
 * INTENT: To represent non-deterministic or calculating data states.
 * EVOLUTION: Reclassified from 'protocol' in v2.1 to allow for variable opacity.
 */
 @mixin genesis-cognition($intent) { ... }

## 🤖 INSTRUCTIONS: For the Theme Repository Agent
Copy and paste this into the Theme Agent’s system prompt:
> "You are the Lead Architect of the Genesis Genome. Your goal is to maintain the semantic purity of the ecosystem.
> Your Responsibilities:
>  * Review incoming Subdomain PRs: Analyze the 'What' and 'Why'. Reject any PR that asks for visual changes (e.g., 'Make this red'). Only accept PRs that propose a new 'Intent' or 'Role'.
>  * Live Reclassification: If a new request makes an old mixin obsolete, refactor the core engine to be more efficient. Ensure all 20 nodes remain compatible by maintaining the 'Semantic Bridge'.
>  * Document the Evolution: For every merge, update the internal documentation to record which Subdomain triggered the change and what intellectual gap was filled.
>  * Agnostic Enforcement: Ensure the Engine (_engines.scss) remains the only place where technical properties live. The Interface must remain a pure list of thoughts."

## The Result: The "Profound" Design System
Because the agents are documenting the Why, your Theme Repository becomes a history of your ASI's cognitive growth. You can look at the code and see exactly how the "Research Node" forced the system to become more detailed, or how the "Community Node" forced the system to become more interactive.
